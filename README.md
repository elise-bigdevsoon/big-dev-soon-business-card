## Hello to [BigDevSoon](https://bigdevsoon.me/) 👋

Create code that matters! 🤩

Level up your coding skills by building real-world projects with professional designs.

## Project brief

Craft a dynamic digital **Business Card** tailored for the modern developer. It's not just an ordinary card, but a vibrant reflection of you. Set the stage for your personal or professional digital presence and ensure you stand out in the vast digital realm.

### What you will learn

- **HTML Mastery**: Enhance your foundational HTML skills by crafting a structured and accessible content layout, turning design concepts into interactive web pages.

- **CSS Deep Dive**: Engage with advanced CSS techniques to create full-page backgrounds, center-aligned layouts, and absolute-positioned shapes. Dive into the intricacies of styling different content sections for a polished aesthetic.

- **Interactive Animations**: Elevate user experience by integrating subtle animations like fade-ins and skeleton loading. This provides a dynamic touch, ensuring a captivating first impression.

### Requirements

- Create a full-page background with a centered card layout.
- Add a user contact section on the left of the card with email, phone, and clickable social icons.
- Add a user image in the center of the card.
- Add a user info section on the right of the card with name, position, location, description, and technologies.
- Implement absolute-positioned shapes to improve the layout.
- Enhance user experience with animations, such as image-loading skeleton animation or fade-in effects.

## Project assets

Each project comes with additional assets to aid your implementation:

**Starter Files**: Get started with project templates, assets, and resources to kickstart your development process. Simple HTML/CSS/JS files are included.

**Project images**: Access a collection of a few chosen preview project images that can be used to enhance your project.

**Unique Screenshots**: Most cards in the project come with unique screenshots that provide visual guidance for your project's design and requirements.

Additionally, you have the option to download the comprehensive Figma Design for 3 BigTokens. This design includes all visual states and a robust Design System to ensure consistency and precision in your implementation. The "Download Figma design" button is available whenever you choose to elevate your project experience.

## Get started

1. Click the "Start Project" button on the project's page in our app to begin your project.
2. Explore the available project assets, including images, starter files, and unique card screenshots to understand the project's scope.
3. For a comprehensive project experience, download the Figma design for 3 BigTokens.
4. Configure your "Coding setup" using Glitch or GitHub if desired.
5. Dive into the project details through the cards for a deeper understanding.
6. Start coding using your preferred technologies.
7. Refer to the documentation or ask for assistance if needed.
8. Submit your solution, let it shine, and share it with other folks!

## Implementation

Embrace the freedom of choice in your implementation. Whether you're using familiar tools or experimenting with new ones, make this project uniquely yours. Use any combination of languages, libraries, or frameworks as you desire. Push boundaries, learn, and make something to be proud of. 😊

**Setup & Environment**: You can use both [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), a cloud-based editor perfect for quick starts and live previews, or [GitHub](https://github.com/) to lay the groundwork. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is an excellent choice for those building a portfolio or keen on mastering Git. If you're new to coding, consider beginning with [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to bypass the initial Git learning curve.

No matter your platform choice, feel free to overwrite repository files to suit your project structure. We've included a set of starter files and an `assets` folder, extracted from the design, to streamline your setup process.

**Structuring your project**: Whether you're pacing yourself with Freerun's card-by-card approach or diving into the deep end with Speedrun, it's essential to segment your work. Break down the project into smaller components or sections and plan the implementation based on the provided designs.

### Getting help when stuck

**Community**: Reach out to our "Community questions" section in the project for support. Remember, connecting your Discord account grants you 1 BigToken on your first connection!

**ChatGPT**: For intricate, technical concerns, the "ChatGPT" section in the project is at your disposal. A BIG subscription is required to access this feature.

## Review

Before finalizing your project, take a moment to review your work. This process ensures the quality of your code and fosters self-growth:

1. **Self-Review**: Start by examining your own code. Use this time for introspection, checking that you've adhered to the project's goals and requirements.

2. **Community review**: If you're looking for external opinions, our community is a great place to turn. Fellow developers can offer fresh perspectives, pointing out areas for refinement.

3. **ChatGPT review**: Alternatively, if you're after technical insights, the "ChatGPT" section in the project offers in-depth analysis. This AI-powered tool pinpoints areas of improvement and helps to elevate your code quality.

## Guidelines

1. **Project Planning**: Start by reviewing the design and requirements. Get a good grasp of the project's scope. This foresight can save you time and rework later on.

2. **Design Fidelity**: Strive for a close match with the design. However, creative variations are welcome, especially if they enhance UX/UI. Tools like [PixelParallel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelparallel-by-htmlburg/iffnoibnepbcloaaagchjonfplimpkob?hl=en) can assist in ensuring design accuracy.

3. **Code Quality**: Ensure your code is clean and efficient. Extensions like [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) users, are invaluable. For beginners, platforms like [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) simplify the coding journey.

4. **Tech Stack Choices**: Choose the right technologies that align with the project's needs. Whether it's a particular framework, library, or platform, your choice can impact the project's flexibility, scalability, and efficiency.

5. **Version Control**: While optional, version control systems like Git can be beneficial, especially for larger projects. If you're keen, delve into [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), but simplicity is fine for newcomers or straightforward projects.

6. **Testing & Quality Assurance**: Prioritize testing to ensure your project runs seamlessly. Conduct both automated tests, using tools like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and manual tests to navigate the application as a user would. Vigilance in identifying and rectifying bugs will lead to a more robust and trustworthy final product.

Ultimately, the beauty of this project lies in the journey and the learning. Use tools that make your workflow efficient and add your unique touch to the design. 💡

## Submit solution

Whether you've just begun or are wrapping up, you have the flexibility to submit your project at any stage via the "Submit solution" button. This not only allows for iterative improvements but also offers a chance to garner feedback early on, making your learning more effective.

Here's a quick guide to ensure a smooth submission:

1. **Cloud-Based Editors**: If you're using cloud-based platforms like [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) or [Replit](https://replit.com/), submission is straightforward. These platforms automatically provide you with both code and preview links.

2. **Manual Deployment**: For those who've built projects on local environments or prefer platforms that require manual deployment, consider services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

3. **Tag Check**: Ensure the `<bds />` tag is present in your `index.html`. This is a crucial step as we'll verify its presence during submission.

4. **Optional Feedback via Discord**: If you've connected your Discord account within our app, you can optionally request feedback during submission. This will initiate a thread on Discord where community members can provide insights. Each thread includes key links such as your repository and preview URL, making it easier for peers to review and comment.

Remember, the aim is not just to finish but to learn and grow. Iterative submissions and community feedback can greatly amplify your learning experience. Best of luck with your project journey!
